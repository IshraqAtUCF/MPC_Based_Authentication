# AuthenTree & SAFE-SiP: Secure Authentication for Chiplet-Based SiP

## Overview

**AuthenTree** is a scalable, distributed authentication framework designed for heterogeneous System-in-Package (SiP) platforms. Building upon the core ideas of **SAFE-SiP**, AuthenTree eliminates centralized trust anchors, minimizes area and power overhead, and delivers robust security using modern cryptographic primitives. This repository provides the Verilog RTL implementation of our optimized SHA-256 core, which forms the basis of the AuthenTree protocol.

- **SAFE-SiP**: Introduces signature-based chiplet authentication, leveraging cryptographic garbling and MPC for robust SiP integrity.
- **AuthenTree**: Extends SAFE-SiP with a decentralized, tree-based protocol using SHA-256 and threshold secret sharing, enabling parallel, lightweight authentication for next-generation chiplet systems.

## Features

- [x] Synthesizable SHA-256 RTL core (`src/sha256.v`)
- [ ] AuthenTree threshold/MPC protocol RTL (coming soon)
- [ ] Example testbenches and integration scripts

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authentree.git
   cd authentree
   ```

2. **Synthesize for ASIC/FPGA:**

Compatible with Synopsys Design Compiler and Xilinx Vivado.

See source files for module port descriptions.

### AuthenTree at a Glance

Scalable: Tree-based, decentralized protocol for large heterogeneous systems.

Parallelizable: Lightweight, one-time authentication; minimizes bottlenecks.

Low Overhead: Area and power impact is orders of magnitude smaller than recent alternatives.

Robust: Sensitive to tampering, replay, and DoS attacks.
